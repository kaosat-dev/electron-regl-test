### What is this ?
Just a simple test for [Regl](https://github.com/regl-project/regl) features using a more controlable 'Chrome'
environment.

It repackages the Regl [examples](https://github.com/regl-project/regl-gallery) into an electon app


##setup & use

Install
```
npm install
```

launch app
```
npm run start
```

Navigate / use the gallery and press the 'esc' key to go back to the main menu
